    <string name="short_text">Storms that form over the Atlantic and eastern Pacific Ocean are called \'Hurricanes\'.
        Storms develop only over warm ocean waters near the equator.
        The warm, moist air over the ocean rises upward leaving an area of low pressure. Surrounding air from high-pressure area swirls in to take its place, which again warms up and rises, thereby feeding the hurricane.</string>
